Floodplain wetlands represent important and sometimes critical habitats for small-bodied freshwater fish species. Wetland areas expand and contract following flooding, and their landscape context, degree of permanence and physico-chemical conditions can strongly influence the distribution and survival of fish. To explore these processes, we analysed distribution patterns of 7 native small-bodied and 4 exotic fish species in wetlands of 15 catchments in the Southern Murray Darling Basin (SMDB). We examined the large-scale spatial and temporal environmental drivers influencing wetland dynamics to understand the role of assembly processes structuring wetland fish communities. Additionally, we included species-specific traits incorporating aspects of life history and reproduction to understand how these variables relate to species niches and environmental responses. Furthermore, we recorded species co-occurrences to provide insights on potential interactions between species. We assesed the role of these variables Using Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDM) and you can find a step by step description of the process in the attached files.
